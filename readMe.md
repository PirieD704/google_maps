#Google Maps API Project

###For this project, I used data from 39 of the largest cities in the US to attribute functionality to.  The entire project is run off of Angular.JS. Custom markers are currently added for a few of each of the cities (Atl, New York, and Charlotte).  The table on the right-hand side of the page uses bootstrap incorporating a overflow: scroll and striped: hover stylings to convenience and clarity purposes.
